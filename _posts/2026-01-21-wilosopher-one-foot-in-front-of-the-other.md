I didn’t wake up one day and decide I wanted a “brand.”

I woke up realizing I wanted more.

More growth. More discipline. More meaning. More legacy. More impact. And honestly — more life. The kind of life that feels earned.

So this is my first real step into building something I can own. I just created my first live landing page on GitHub, and this blog is the start of me documenting the journey.

Not perfectly. Just honestly.

## Who I am

My name is **Willard Wells**, but most people know me as **Willy**.

I’m Jamaican. I’m an **IT Support Technician at Hillel Academy**, a K1–12 international school.

That means my world is troubleshooting, systems, structure, problem-solving, and helping people solve tech issues **quickly and properly**.

Most days I live inside a Google-based environment — supporting staff and students, and keeping things running smoothly.

## What I’m building

Over time I realized something:

I don’t just want to consume knowledge. I want to **produce value**.

So I started building multiple projects at once, and each one says something about who I am.

---

## Content creation

I’m a creator. I’ve grown multiple accounts past **50,000 followers combined**, and I’m still sharpening that skill.

My content style is different.

I prefer to be **heard more than seen**.

I like subtle, layered meaning. Humor. Honesty. Clever writing.  
I don’t want noise. I want impact.

My pages include:

- **Wilosopher** — my voice and reflections  
- **JamrockAI** — Jamaican culture + storytelling (short-form focus)

## When Wi Hungry

Food is serious business.

I created a food review account called **When Wi Hungry** because Jamaican food deserves storytelling, not just ratings.

Not everyone needs to see my face chewing.

What I want is wit, originality, smart comedy, honest reviews — and a voice people recognize anywhere.

## Lifestyle Hikers: Jamaica through sweat and scenery

I’m part of **Lifestyle Hikers**, a group that started in 2019 with only 5 members and grew to **50+**.

We hike across Jamaica for free — **three Saturdays each month**. It’s fitness, yes, but it’s also community, mental strength, and freedom.

I’ve been to places like:

- **Reggae Falls** (St. Thomas)  
- **Blue Mountain Chincona**  
- **Catherine’s Peak**  
- **Spanish Bridge**

Hiking taught me something simple:

Progress isn’t dramatic. It’s repeated.

**One foot in front of the other.**

## AI and automation

I’m big on AI — not as hype, but as leverage.

I build real systems.

I’ve already built working automation workflows that can:

- pull video files from Google Drive  
- generate titles and descriptions using AI  
- upload to YouTube  

And that system can expand into other platforms.

My approach is simple:

**AI is not replacement. It’s augmentation.**

## Why this blog exists

This blog isn’t here to impress anyone.

It’s here to document the truth.

I’m building myself into the version of me that can’t be ignored — not because I’m loud, but because I’m consistent.

I’ve said before:

**Nothing’s hard if you have discipline and determination and dedication.**

And I meant it.

I’m done being comfortable. I want wealth, wisdom, peace, and health. And I’m willing to put in the work for it.

This blog is part of that work.

## The personal parts: the fuel

Life has tested me.

I lost my sister, **Esther Roselyn Wells** (Mary).  
Then I lost my mother, **Avril May Harvey**.

That kind of pain changes you.

What I miss most is my mother’s laughter, her humor, her moral strength, her kindness, her sorrel at Christmas, and her Sunday rice and peas and fish.

I don’t share this for sympathy.

I share it because it’s part of why I push.

I’m chasing legacy now.

Not vibes.

**Legacy.**

## What you can expect here

This blog will mix:

- Jamaican storytelling  
- lessons from hiking and life  
- tech growth + automation progress  
- AI tools and real use cases  
- content creation strategy  
- philosophy without the fake deep  
- truth when needed  

Sometimes poetic.  
Sometimes funny.  
Sometimes serious.

But always real.

## Final thought

I once coined a phrase that still feels like a compass:

**It’s always the right time somewhere else.**

Meaning: stop waiting for the perfect moment.

The perfect moment is already happening — just not in your comfort zone.

So this is me stepping out.

GitHub landing page live.  
Blog started.  
Momentum activated.

**One foot in front of the other.**
